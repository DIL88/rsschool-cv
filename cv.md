## About me
I'm 34 years old. I work as a bar-manager, but I want to change my profession and that's why I'm talking JavaScript/Front-end courses. 
This is very interesting for me and I hope that soon I will master this profession and be able to work in it.

## Code examples
Complete the solution so that it returns true if the first argument (string) passed in ends with the 2nd argument (also a string).
```
function solution (str, ending) {
  return str.slice(str.length - ending.length, str.length) === ending;
}
```
